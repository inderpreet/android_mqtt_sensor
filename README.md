# Simple Android App for reading sensor data and sending it over via MQTT

This is a work in progress for an Android Application that will read sensor data from an ambient sensor
and then send it over cellular network to an MQTT broker. Once this is working, it can be merged with
bluetooth sensors to read a number of variables and then send them to the cloud for processing.

The original MQTT app is by [Thumar](https://github.com/Thumar/MQTT)

## Progress

- The basic MQTT functionality works thanks to the original author.
